<h3> Education</h3>
<p>as a child, i've been to many schools. but i first started off as my parents teaching me at home. then, at around the age of
6/7, i went to a local school called 'Lionel Primary School' and finished there in year 6 when i was 11. then it was
time for me to go to highschool, so i went to another local school called 'Brentford School for Girls' which wasn't a good school. :/
